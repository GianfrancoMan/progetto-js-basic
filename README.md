<h1>Counter</h1>
<p>This project is the exam of the "Javascript-Basic" course of the <a href="https://start2impact.it">Start2Impact</a> University</p>
<h3>Technologies:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>Html</li>
    <li>Scss</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Develop a Javascript application that has two buttons that allow the user to increase or decrease a visible counter.</p>
<p>Both user actions and counter value changes must be implemented with Javascript.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I added some small effects on the counter element when a user increases or decreases his level by clicking the "up" or "down" button.</p>
<p>Furthermore I have implemented a new element, the reset button, which allows the user to reset the counter value to zero, this button is only visible if the counter value is different from zero</p>
